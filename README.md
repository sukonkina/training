# training

In this training I learnt:

 that an HDF5 file is a file with the Hierarchical Data Format, that supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and complex data.
  
 to create an hdf5 file, specifying not only a file name, but a file access mode: create_hdf5.py

 to copy an hdf5 file using system calls: copy_hdf5.py

 to check the error messages using try/except: copy_sys_calls.py

 to calculate the checksum of the file: checksum_hdf5.py

 to create one or multiple directories at a time with different access rights: directory.py

 usage of RSYNC and its options for keeping file folders and directories synchronized

 LOGGIN 

 to start the project in Version Control and operate with the files (write, update).
